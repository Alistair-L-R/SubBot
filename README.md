# SubBot
Clicks the subscribe button so you don't have to.

Only works on Windows computers (or at least that's all I've tested).
To download, download the msi file and run the installer here: https://github.com/Alistair-L-R/SubBot/releases/tag/1.0

It might take a while to click because of the processing required.
Also sometimes doesn't work due to subscribe buttons looking different on other people's computers, so if it fails to find matchings three times in a row, just quit the program.
Feel free to look at the source code and try compiling yourself, I used Visual Studio 2019 to write the code.

The program should auto close after it's clicked the subscribe button.
Once you're subscribed, you should probably uninstall the program because it's pretty much useless after that.
