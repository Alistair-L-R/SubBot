# SubBot
Clicks the subscribe button so you don't have to.

Only works on Windows computers (or at least that's all I've tested).
To download, download the msi file and run the installer here: https://github.com/Alistair-L-R/SubBot/releases/tag/1.0

It might take a while to click because of the 10 second timer.
Feel free to look at the source code and try compiling yourself, I used Visual Studio 2019 to write the code.
